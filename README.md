# ConfessIt README

This repository contains the source code for <https://confessit.app>.

We welcome anyone who would like to contribute to this project. Please see our [code of conduct](./code_of_conduct.md) for more information. And feel free to get in touch by starting a [discussion](https://github.com/kas-catholic/confessit-web/discussions) or commenting on an [issue](https://github.com/kas-catholic/confessit-web/issues) here on GitHub.

## Development

1. We highly recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage your Node installation. See the [nvm Installation Instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script). We have a `.nvmrc` checked in, so running `nvm install` in this project directory after setting up nvm will ensure the correct Node version is installed.
2. We use [Yarn 2](https://yarnpkg.com/) to manage our dependencies. The [Yarn Installation Instructions](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) recommend running `corepack enable` to install Yarn.
3. Install the project dependencies with `yarn install`.
4. Run `yarn start` as described [below](#yarn-start) to build the project and run the development server. You can kill the server with `CTRL-C` and restart it any time with `yarn start` again.

This project is a [progressive web app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app/) React app and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Reading the [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) and [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started) docs will help you get started if you're not already familiar with these frameworks. We use [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) as our CSS framework and [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) for translations.

See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information about how to contribute to the development of ConfessIt.

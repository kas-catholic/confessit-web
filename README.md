# ConfessIt README

This repository contains the source code for <https://confessit.app>.

We welcome anyone who would like to contribute to this project. Please see our [code of conduct](./code_of_conduct.md) for more information. And feel free to get in touch by starting a [discussion](https://github.com/kas-catholic/confessit-web/discussions) or commenting on an [issue](https://github.com/kas-catholic/confessit-web/issues) here on GitHub.

## Development

1. We highly recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage your Node installation. See the [nvm Installation Instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script). We have a `.nvmrc` checked in, so running `nvm install` in this project directory after setting up nvm will ensure the correct Node version is installed.
2. We use NPM to manage our dependencies. Install the project dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev` to build the project and run the development server. You can kill the server with `CTRL-C` and restart it any time with `npm run dev` again.

This project is a [progressive web app](https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/) [Astro](https://astro.build/) app with React. Reading the [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) and [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/) docs will help you get started if you're not already familiar with these frameworks. We use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) as our CSS framework and [astro-i18next](https://astro-i18next.yassinedoghri.com/) for translations.

See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information about how to contribute to the development of ConfessIt.

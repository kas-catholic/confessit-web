              My Lord and God, I have sinned. I am guilty before you.<br />
              Grant me the strength to say to Your minister what I say to You in the secret of my heart.<br />
              Increase my repentance. Make it more genuine. May it really be a sorrow for having offended You and my neighbor rather than a wounded love of self.<br />
              Help me to atone for my sin. May the sufferings of my life and my little mortifications be joined with the sufferings of Jesus, Your Son, and cooperate in rooting sin from the world.<br />
              Amen.

              I am sorry for my sins with all my heart.<br />
              In choosing to do wrong and failing to do good, I have sinned against You, whom I should love above all things.<br />

              I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee, and I detest all of my sins, because I dread the loss of heaven, and the pains of hell;<br />
              but most of all because they offend Thee, my God, Who are all good and deserving of my love.<br />

              My dearest Jesus,<br />
              I have told all my sins as well as I could. I have tried hard to make a good confession. I feel sure that You have forgiven me. I thank You. It is only because of all Your sufferings that I can go to confession and free myself from my sins. Your heart is full of love and mercy for poor sinners. I love You because You are so good to me.<br />
              My loving Savior,<br />
              I shall try to keep from sin and to love you more each day.<br />

              pray for me and help me to keep my promises. Protect me and do not let me fall back into sin.

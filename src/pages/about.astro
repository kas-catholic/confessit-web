        examination of conscience for computers, tablets, and phones. It's designed
        to be simple and easy to use, and it can help you remember your sins when
        you go to confession. There's also a confession walkthrough that tells you
        exactly what the priest will say and how you should respond - a great resource
        if you haven't been to confession in a while! The examination of conscience
        is based on fundamental Catholic church teachings, is easy to understand,
        and is relevant for modern Catholics.

          It is called the sacrament of conversion because it makes
          sacramentally present Jesus' call to conversion, the first step in
          returning to the Father (Cf. Mk 1:15; Lk 15:18) from whom one has
          strayed by sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is called the sacrament of Penance, since it consecrates the
          Christian sinner's personal and ecclesial steps of conversion,
          penance, and satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is called the sacrament of confession, since the disclosure or
          confession of sins to a priest is an essential element of this
          sacrament. In a profound sense it is also a "confession" -
          acknowledgment and praise - of the holiness of God and of his mercy
          toward sinful man.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is called the sacrament of forgiveness, since by the priest's
          sacramental absolution God grants the penitent "pardon and peace"
          (Ordo paenitantiae 46 formula of absolution).
        </p>
        <p>
          It is called the sacrament of Reconciliation, because it imparts to
          the sinner the love of God who reconciles: "Be reconciled to God" (2
          Cor 5:20). He who lives by God's merciful love is ready to respond to
          the Lord's call: "Go; first be reconciled to your brother" (Mt 5:24).
        </p>

        <p>
          Conversion to Christ, the new birth of Baptism, the gift of the Holy
          Spirit and the Body and Blood of Christ received as food have made us
          "holy and without blemish," just as the Church herself, the Bride of
          Christ, is "holy and without blemish" (Eph 1:4; 5:27). Nevertheless
          the new life received in Christian initiation has not abolished the
          frailty and weakness of human nature, nor the inclination to sin that
          tradition calls concupiscence, which remains in the baptized such that
          with the help of the grace of Christ they may prove themselves in the
          struggle of Christian life (Cf. Council of Trent, DS 1545; Lumen
          Gentium 40). This is the struggle of conversion directed toward
          holiness and eternal life to which the Lord never ceases to call us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus calls to conversion. This call is an essential part of the
          proclamation of the kingdom: "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom
          of God is at hand; repent, and believe in the gospel" (Mk 1:15).
          Baptism is the principal place for the first and fundamental
          conversion, but then Christ's call to conversion continues to resound
          in the lives of Christians. This second conversion is an uninterrupted
          task for the whole Church who, "clasping sinners to her bosom, (is) at
          once holy and always in need of purification, (and) follows constantly
          the path of penance and renewal" (Lumen Gentium 8). This endeavor of
          conversion is not just a human work. It is the movement of a "contrite
          heart," drawn and moved by grace to respond to the merciful love of
          God who loved us first (Ps 51:17; Jn 6:44; 12:32; 1 Jn 4:10). St.
          Ambrose says of the two conversions that, in the Church, "there are
          water and tears: the water of Baptism and the tears of repentance"
          (epistle 41).

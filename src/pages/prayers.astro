        My Lord and God, I have sinned. I am guilty before you.
        <br />
        Grant me the strength to say to Your minister what I say to You in the secret
        of my heart.
        <br />
        Increase my repentance. Make it more genuine. May it really be a sorrow for
        having offended You and my neighbor rather than a wounded love of self.
        <br />
        Help me to atone for my sin. May the sufferings of my life and my little
        mortifications be joined with the sufferings of Jesus, Your Son, and cooperate
        in rooting sin from the world.

        but most of all because they offend Thee, my God, Who are all good and deserving

        I have told all my sins as well as I could. I have tried hard to make a good
        confession. I feel sure that You have forgiven me. I thank You. It is only
        because of all Your sufferings that I can go to confession and free myself
        from my sins. Your heart is full of love and mercy for poor sinners. I love
        You because You are so good to me.
        <br />
        My loving Savior,
        <br />
        I shall try to keep from sin and to love you more each day.

        My dear Mother Mary,

        pray for me and help me to keep my promises. Protect me and do not let me
        fall back into sin.

    "ccc_quote": "<p>It is called the sacrament of conversion because it makes sacramentally present Jesus' call to conversion, the first step in returning to the Father (Cf. Mk 1:15; Lk 15:18) from whom one has strayed by sin.</p><p>It is called the sacrament of Penance, since it consecrates the Christian sinner's personal and ecclesial steps of conversion, penance, and satisfaction.</p><p>It is called the sacrament of confession, since the disclosure or confession of sins to a priest is an essential element of this sacrament. In a profound sense it is also a \"confession\" - acknowledgment and praise - of the holiness of God and of his mercy toward sinful man.</p><p>It is called the sacrament of forgiveness, since by the priest's sacramental absolution God grants the penitent \"pardon and peace\" (Ordo paenitantiae 46 formula of absolution).</p><p>It is called the sacrament of Reconciliation, because it imparts to the sinner the love of God who reconciles: \"Be reconciled to God\" (2 Cor 5:20). He who lives by God's merciful love is ready to respond to the Lord's call: \"Go; first be reconciled to your brother\" (Mt 5:24).</p><p>Conversion to Christ, the new birth of Baptism, the gift of the Holy Spirit and the Body and Blood of Christ received as food have made us \"holy and without blemish,\" just as the Church herself, the Bride of Christ, is \"holy and without blemish\" (Eph 1:4; 5:27). Nevertheless the new life received in Christian initiation has not abolished the frailty and weakness of human nature, nor the inclination to sin that tradition calls concupiscence, which remains in the baptized such that with the help of the grace of Christ they may prove themselves in the struggle of Christian life (Cf. Council of Trent, DS 1545; Lumen Gentium 40). This is the struggle of conversion directed toward holiness and eternal life to which the Lord never ceases to call us.</p><p>Jesus calls to conversion. This call is an essential part of the proclamation of the kingdom: \"The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent, and believe in the gospel\" (Mk 1:15). Baptism is the principal place for the first and fundamental conversion, but then Christ's call to conversion continues to resound in the lives of Christians. This second conversion is an uninterrupted task for the whole Church who, \"clasping sinners to her bosom, (is) at once holy and always in need of purification, (and) follows constantly the path of penance and renewal\" (Lumen Gentium 8). This endeavor of conversion is not just a human work. It is the movement of a \"contrite heart,\" drawn and moved by grace to respond to the merciful love of God who loved us first (Ps 51:17; Jn 6:44; 12:32; 1 Jn 4:10). St. Ambrose says of the two conversions that, in the Church, \"there are water and tears: the water of Baptism and the tears of repentance\" (epistle 41).</p><footer>— Catechism of the Catholic Church 1423-1424,1426; cf. 1427-1429</footer>",

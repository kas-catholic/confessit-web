# Contributing to ConfessIt

We collaborate to develop ConfessIt on the [Open Source Catholic](https://www.opensourcecatholic.com/chat/) Slack channel, and we invite you to join us there.

## Contributing Translations

We use [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) to manage our translations. **We want to support more languages, and welcome translation additions and improvements!** Translation files are stored in [public/locales](public/locales). You can test your translation by appending, for example, `?lng=es` to the end of the URL.

Note that we make several citations to the [Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC)](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc/index.htm) and the Bible, and your translation should preserve these citations. We use the following translations of the Bible:

- **en**: Revised Standard Version - Second Catholic Edition (RSV-2CE)

To assist in the translation process, you can use the Weblate interface, available at https://translate.johnromanodorazio.com/engage/confessit-web/ .

## Contributing Code

Pull requests are always welcome! For substantial changes, your code is most likely to be merged quickly if we've discussed the change first to make sure it aligns with our roadmap and vision. Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/kas-catholic/confessit-web/issues), [start a discussion](https://github.com/kas-catholic/confessit-web/discussions), or reach out to us on [Slack](https://www.opensourcecatholic.com/chat/) if you'd like to get in touch before submitting a PR.
